NanoVG
===================

I do not own this library, this is merely a Makefile version of the original library from: <https://github.com/memononen/nanovg> 

**How to install**
This will install into `/usr/local` folder. You can override `prefix` parameter to install it into a different directory. Example: `sudo make install prefix=/blabla/blabla`
```
cd nanovg
sudo make install
```
